This project entails creating a dynamic, animated Haunted Theme Park using C++, GLUT, and OpenGL. Daytime features lively rides with visitors, while nighttime introduces ghosts activating rides and destroying boats in the river. A lighthouse guides ships, and a lakeside building adds depth to the scene. Code Blocks is used for implementation, offering a visually engaging, interactive experience with a seamless day-night transition.
